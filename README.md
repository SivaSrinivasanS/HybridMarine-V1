# HybridMarine-V1: Multi-Source Energy Harvesting Vessel

**A conceptual CAD study of a trimaran-based marine vessel powered by integrated wave, tidal, and wind energy systems.**

---

## 🌊 Project Overview

**HybridMarine-V1** explores the spatial feasibility and design integration of renewable energy systems within a trimaran-style vessel platform. The goal is to reduce marine fuel dependency through modular, maintainable, and scalable architecture.

**Project Characteristics:**
- 📦 Conceptual CAD study (non-parametric)
- ⚙️ Developed using CATIA V5 and ANSYS (static prep)
- 🧭 Industry Focus: Renewable Marine Propulsion & Sustainable Naval Architecture
